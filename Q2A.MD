Q2A_ISSUES_WITH_NOTEPAD

Questions should to ask :-

What version of Notepad are you using?

Is the system running slowly, or experiencing performance issues when closing Notepad, such as delays in prompts or unexpected behavior?

Have you checked if the "Save on Close" option is enabled or disabled in Notepad (or any relevant setting in the operating system)?

Does this behavior occur only with certain types of files (e.g., text files, large files, etc.) or is it happening with all file types?

Are there any custom settings or configurations applied to the Notepad or Windows environment (such as third-party software, system settings, or accessibility features)?

As the issue started after a specific update or patch was applied to your system? Can you track back to when the issue began?
