Suggested questions to ask:-

Have there been any recent Excel updates or changes to the computer's settings?

-Has the file been shared with others, or is it stored on a network drive?

-Has the cell format for the formula cells been set to something other than "General" or "Number"?

-Have there been any recent Excel updates or changes to the computer's settings?

-Are there any text indicators in the formula cells (e.g., an apostrophe before the formula)?

-Is Excel's calculation mode set to "Manual" or "Automatic"?

Is the formula showing an error code (e.g., #NAME?, #VALUE!) or just the formula itself?
